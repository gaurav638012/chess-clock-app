This is a basic chess clock for a timed chess game
	The first display is the clock window which contains the last configuration of the clock used.
	The last config is stored in helo.csv.This is done since if game closes unexpectedly by random clicks or
	exit then it can be retrieved.
	Then there is alternating color change to indicate the move.
	There also exists white panel and black panel with indication to know who is black and white.
	Also have pause/resume button,exit button and refresh button
	Pause and resume button used to pause and resume which allows user to pause if needed
	Refresh button is used to reset the values if new game is created and we do not want to create an new version
  	every time.
	Exit button is used to move back and forth to timer page and creating page
	While exit button is called the game is automatically paused
	
	Also in refresh button we have a popup which is beneficial since if a player touches the refresh button by
	mistake so it asks if want to refresh.If given yes then it is refreshed
	
	Then the button color keeps changing and becomes red if time becomes zero,after which either cant play.
	So refresh creates a new version of the game or exit and creation or existing use of history can be used

	Exit button leads us to a another page which contains move to timer button and new game creation button
	
	In new game creation button u can set white time,black time and also the corresponding increments
	Once the set button is pressed it asks for confirmation using a new popup
	
	We also have history of games which contain games which were created.Since all cannot be displayed top ten created
	times are displayed in last to first created order.So clicking on the history allows u to set the time associated 
	with the history.It again asks for a conformation(popup) on giving yes allows to the timer window values set.
	So u can keep toggling between timer window and creation window

Additions:
	login and signup(not much useful)
	absorbing the white black  time interval for each moves in every game(data collection) to predict winner.
	more complicated modes of clock
	settings page to allow the user to customize the layout in buttons and history
	more features to handle history 
	add more graphics and pictures

Mistakes done:
	handled time variable very bad leading to a cumborsome code
	ideally should rewamp so that if i could represent and handle time variable in all situations
	then the code will become shorter
	to much reluctancy in the initial part and not trying to think the source of problem but wander 
	around like without focus
	could have done little more if managed time well

Learning Curve:
	New experience since not worked much in graphics and widgets.
	Learning how to learn and debug independantly
	Since i was alone i completely debugged everything without help which is not possible if with friends
	Increased confidence to do developement about which i was very reluctant in the first place
	Learning to code more length of code and debug everytime
	Good experience needed for my upcoming years
